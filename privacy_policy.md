Privacy Policy for Correct Horse Password Generator

Last updated: 1 July 2025

⸻

1.  Overview

This Chrome extension generates random pass-phrases in the style of XKCD #936. All processing happens entirely inside your browser; no data ever leaves your device.

2.  Data We Collect

We do not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII).
The extension:
	•	Reads nothing from the pages you visit.
	•	Writes the newly generated password to your system clipboard only after you click the context-menu item.
	•	Never sends telemetry, analytics, or logs to any server.

3.  How We Use Data

Generated passwords are copied to your clipboard so that you can paste them elsewhere. We do not retain, sync, or share them.

4.  Chrome Permissions Explained

Permission	Purpose	Scope
contextMenus	Adds the “Generate Password” item you right-click to use.	Local browser UI only
clipboardWrite	Copies the generated password to your clipboard.	Single user-initiated action
offscreen	Uses a short-lived off-screen document required by Chrome to perform the clipboard write.	No content or URLs are accessed

The extension requests no host permissions (<all_urls> has been removed) and cannot read site content.

5.  Data Sharing

We share nothing with third parties—no advertisers, analytics providers, or cloud services.

6.  Data Security

Because data never leaves your computer, exposure risk is limited to your local environment. We follow Chrome’s best practices: least-privilege permissions, short-lived off-screen documents, and no remote code.

7.  User Controls
	•	Remove the extension at any time via chrome://extensions.
	•	Clear your clipboard manually if you no longer need the generated password.

8.  Children’s Privacy

The extension is not directed to children under 13 and collects no information that could identify them.

9.  Changes to This Policy

Updates will appear on the extension’s Chrome Web Store page and take effect immediately upon posting. The “Last updated” date reflects the latest revision.

10.  Contact
